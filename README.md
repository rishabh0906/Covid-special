# Covid-special

As we know , In this Covid-19 ,Needs are high , Resources are less or if there are resources That are not available to common man because of having less information or less reach to that information . So i made this project using node , javascript , puppeteer 
project includes webscapping and automation in which program visit covid related website (https://covid.army) and fetch information about people needs like beds ,oxygen cylinders, plasma and many more . Store this data as Json file (see additionals) with there respective names(plasma.json , remedisivir.json ,etc. ) for easily available.
Then , Some instances (because it's lot of lot of Data !! ) of this data is uploaded to facebook as post with their website links  so that it increase the reach of valuable information with large community.
